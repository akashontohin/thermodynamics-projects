# Thermodynamics ML Projects
## Project 1:
**Project Title:** Predicting Heat Conduction in Different Materials

**Project Overview:**
This project aims to build a simple machine learning model to predict heat conduction in different materials based on their thermal properties. Heat conduction is a fundamental concept in heat transfer, and this project will provide insights into how machine learning can be used to make predictions in the context of heat transfer.

**Dataset:**
You can create a small dataset with the following columns:
- Material Type (Categorical)
- Thermal Conductivity (Continuous, in W/m·K)
- Temperature Gradient (Continuous, in °C/m)
- Heat Transfer Rate (Continuous, in W)

**Project Steps:**

1. **Data Collection:** Create a dataset that includes various materials with their known thermal conductivity values, temperature gradients, and heat transfer rates. You can find thermal conductivity values for common materials online or in textbooks.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Encode the categorical "Material Type" column into numerical values.
   - Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

3. **Model Selection:** For simplicity, you can choose a basic linear regression model as your machine learning algorithm.

4. **Model Training:** Train the linear regression model on the training dataset to learn the relationship between thermal conductivity, temperature gradient, and heat transfer rate.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

6. **Predictions:** Allow users to input material type, temperature gradient, and predict heat transfer rate using the trained model.

7. **Visualization:** Create simple visualizations, such as scatter plots or line graphs, to show the actual vs. predicted heat transfer rates.

## Project 2:
**Project Title:** Predicting Thermal Conductivity of Composite Materials

**Project Overview:**
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the thermal conductivity of composite materials. Composite materials are commonly used in engineering applications, and their thermal conductivity is a critical factor in designing efficient heat transfer systems.

**Dataset:**
You can create a dataset with the following columns:
- Composite Composition (Categorical)
- Volume Fraction of Components (Continuous)
- Temperature (Continuous, in °C)
- Thermal Conductivity (Continuous, in W/m·K)

**Project Steps:**

1. **Data Collection:** Create a dataset that includes information about different composite material compositions, their volume fractions of components (e.g., fibers, matrix), temperatures, and corresponding thermal conductivities. Include various composite materials like fiber-reinforced composites.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Encode the categorical "Composite Composition" column into numerical values.
   - Normalize the dataset to ensure uniformity in feature scales.
   - Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

3. **Model Selection:** Choose a machine learning algorithm suitable for regression tasks, such as linear regression or decision trees.

4. **Model Training:** Train the selected model on the training dataset to learn the relationship between composite composition, volume fractions, temperature, and thermal conductivity.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset using regression metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

6. **Predictions:** Allow users to input the composite composition, volume fractions, and temperature to predict the thermal conductivity of the composite material.

7. **Visualization:** Create visualizations (e.g., scatter plots or line graphs) to illustrate the model's predictions compared to actual thermal conductivity values for different composite compositions and temperatures.

## Project 1:
**Project Title:** Predicting Heat Conduction in Different Materials

**Project Overview:**
This project aims to build a simple machine learning model to predict heat conduction in different materials based on their thermal properties. Heat conduction is a fundamental concept in heat transfer, and this project will provide insights into how machine learning can be used to make predictions in the context of heat transfer.

**Dataset:**
You can create a small dataset with the following columns:
- Material Type (Categorical)
- Thermal Conductivity (Continuous, in W/m·K)
- Temperature Gradient (Continuous, in °C/m)
- Heat Transfer Rate (Continuous, in W)

**Project Steps:**

1. **Data Collection:** Create a dataset that includes various materials with their known thermal conductivity values, temperature gradients, and heat transfer rates. You can find thermal conductivity values for common materials online or in textbooks.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Encode the categorical "Material Type" column into numerical values.
   - Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

3. **Model Selection:** For simplicity, you can choose a basic linear regression model as your machine learning algorithm.

4. **Model Training:** Train the linear regression model on the training dataset to learn the relationship between thermal conductivity, temperature gradient, and heat transfer rate.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

6. **Predictions:** Allow users to input material type, temperature gradient, and predict heat transfer rate using the trained model.

7. **Visualization:** Create simple visualizations, such as scatter plots or line graphs, to show the actual vs. predicted heat transfer rates.
